The value of dreams
Angels bearing hope
Hidden in the dusty hollows
Of an old instrument
Uncertain surroundings

Tree seams are splitting
The sky is breaking
Tree seams are splitting
The sky is breaking
Waves of light smashing and smashing
And smashing and smashing themselves to death

The value of dreams
Angels bearing hope
Hidden in the dusty (hollows)
Of an old instrument
Uncertain surroundings
A sky of strange colours

Tree seams are splitting
The sky is breaking
Waves of light smashing and smashing
And smashing and smashing themselves to death

Upflight of butterflies
Following a light that wants to
That wants to conquer, to swallow, to distant, to echo

The stomach of an open field
Nourished by the sun
Growing black minerals
Breeding hidden fire

The sound of the wheel of this earth

Butterflies butterflies butterflies
Butterflies butterflies butterflies
Butterflies butterflies butterflies
